					This image puts the argument made by the author of this article in a
					multimodal form to grab the reader’s attention and clarify itself for
					the reader, showcasing the relationship between the student and the AI

				<p id="robot">
					The AI reaching through the screen and onto the keyboard showcases the
					lack of identity and thought in the student, instead relying on the AI
					for his work.

				<p id="human">
					The student's dreary look implies a sense of disconnection from his
					work, as well as an underlying fear or unease of the AI's control.
