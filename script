The article I chose is “Here’s my AI policy for students: I don’t have one” published on August 29, 2023 on the Washington Post by author Jonathan Zimmerman. The main argument is that while it is difficult to enforce an AI policy on students, students should be encouraged to not rely on AI but instead focus on developing their own independent critical thinking abilities, which is a crucial aspect of education. Zimmerman is successful in arguing his point by building his own credibility, providing logical evidence, and correctly addressing his audience with correct tone and word choice.

This image puts the argument made by the author of this article in a multimodal form to grab the reader’s attention and clarify itself for the reader, showcasing the relationship between the student and the AI in his screen. The dark and gloomy feel emphasizes a sense of guilt in the image. The AI reaching through the screen and onto the keyboard showcases the lack of identity and thought in the student, instead relying on the AI. The unsettling visual captures attention and curiosity. It establishes credibility through common concerns about AI and invokes pathos through a sense of fear of losing control, framing the argument in an image of a robot literally taking control of the person. It is timely with the current situation around AI. Overall, this message was successful in aiding the author’s argument and conveying the warning about AI’s potential overreach, taking control of a student’s work and all their independent and critical thinking skills.
